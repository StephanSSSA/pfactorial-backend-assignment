## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
2. Install MySQL and ensure it is running.
3. Install Redis for caching.

## Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanzi87/storefront.git
cd storefront
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

Install and use pipenv:

```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```

Or if you prefer to use venv instead, you can do so with the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install
```

3. Create a .env file and include the following:

```ini
# Development

DJANGO_DEV_DATABASE_NAME = ...
DJANGO_DEV_DATABASE_HOST = localhost
DJANGO_DEV_DATABASE_USER = ...
DJANGO_DEV_DATABASE_PASS = ...
DJANGO_DEV_DATABASE_PORT = ...

DJANGO_DEV_EMAIL_HOST = ...
DJANGO_DEV_EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
DJANGO_DEV_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''
DJANGO_DEV_EMAIL_PORT = 2525
DJANGO_DEV_FROM_EMAIL = '...'

# Production

DJANGO_DATABASE_NAME = ...
DJANGO_DATABASE_HOST = ...
DJANGO_DATABASE_USER = ...
DJANGO_DATABASE_PASS = ...
DJANGO_DATABASE_PORT = ...

DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST = localhost
DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''
DJANGO_EMAIL_PORT = 25
DJANGO_FROM_EMAIL = '...'
```

4. Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser for admin access:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

7. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to access the application.

## How to Run Tests

Run the tests using pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

## Admin Panel

The admin panel has been enhanced using Jazzmin for a modern UI. Access it at:
[http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)

## Future Enhancements

- Add payment gateway integration.
- Add delivery integration.
- Implement advanced analytics and reporting features.
- Extend caching strategies for improved performance.

## APIs

Shop: [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/shop)
Auth: [http://localhost:8000/auth](http://localhost:8000/auth)
